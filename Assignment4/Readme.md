# Fourth Assignment

This project is the my solution for the [Fourth Assignment](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020-Assignment4) of the IoT course in Sapienza University. It consist to create an HTML5 application using the Generic Sensor API that collects data form the accelerator sensor of the mobile phone.

## Generic Sensor API

The [Generic Sensor API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/sensors-for-the-web#what-is-generic-sensor-api) is a set of interfaces which expose sensor devices to the web platform. The API consists of the base Sensor interface and a set of concrete sensor classes built on top. Having a base interface simplifies the implementation and specification process for the concrete sensor classes.
