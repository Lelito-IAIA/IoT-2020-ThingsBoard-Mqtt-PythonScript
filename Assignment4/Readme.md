# Fourth Assignment

This project is the my solution for the [Fourth Assignment](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020-Assignment4) of the IoT course in Sapienza University. It consist to create an HTML5 application using the Generic Sensor API that collects data form the accelerator sensor of the mobile phone.

## Generic Sensor API

The [Generic Sensor API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/sensors-for-the-web#what-is-generic-sensor-api) is a set of interfaces which expose sensor devices to the web platform. The API consists of the base Sensor interface and a set of concrete sensor classes built on top. Having a base interface simplifies the implementation and specification process for the concrete sensor classes.

## User Activity Recognition

```
Using the data collected at the cloud, you need to develop a simple activity recognition model that detects if the user is standing still, or walking/running/being on a vehicle.
```
The model used is based on the lenght of the vector ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29) generated by the sensor: LinearAcellerationSensor.


Length of the vector:    ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cleft%20%5C%7C%20r%20%5Cright%20%5C%7C%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7Bx%5E2&plus;y%5E2&plus;z%5E2%7D)
#### LinearAccellerationSensor
This is a subclass of Accelerometer, and measures acceleration applied to the device excluding the acceleration contributed by gravity. It uses x, y, and z properties
